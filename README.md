# Analytics-Applications-Engineering

Data Engineering specialization capstone: deployable analytics web service exposing BigQuery-backed satellite classification data and serving in-database ML predictions through a Flask API on Google Cloud Platform.

## 1. Title and Summary

**Analytics Applications Engineering (Data Engineering Specialization Capstone)**  
Northwestern University M.S. in Data Science, Data Engineering specialization: culminating specialization deliverable — a production-style client-server analytics application with REST endpoints, cloud data warehouse integration, BigQuery ML inference, automated testing/linting, and CI/CD deployment to Google App Engine.

## 2. Concepts and Methods

- **Web service design (Flask):** HTTP routes for health check (`/`), read-only analytics export (`GET /get-model`), and CSV upload with prediction response (`POST /satellite-model`); JSON responses via `app.response_class`
- **Cloud data warehouse integration (BigQuery):** `google-cloud-bigquery` client; query existing `sat_analytics` table; load uploaded CSV into ephemeral tables with autodetect schema, `WRITE_TRUNCATE`, and timestamped table names
- **In-database ML inference:** `ML.PREDICT` against pre-trained BigQuery model `sample_model` over uploaded feature columns (`Aattr` through `F30attr`, `class` as label); return prediction rows as JSON
- **Packaging and local execution:** `gunicorn` entrypoint for App Engine Flex; `run.sh` for local dev with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
- **Software engineering workflow:** `Makefile` targets for `venv`, `install`, `pytest` with coverage, and `pylint`; reusable `myrepolib` module pattern for importable library code and unit tests
- **CI/CD (CircleCI):** dependency cache, `make test`, `make lint`, authenticated `gcloud app deploy` on merge
- **Multi-service deployment:** separate App Engine service configs for `default`, `dev`, and `production` (`app.yaml`, `servicedev.yaml`, `serviceprod.yaml`); `deploy.sh` deploys all three

**Project domain:** satellite analytics classification use case; `model.json` holds sample feature records aligned with model input schema

## 3. Stack

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Language | Python 3 |
| Web framework | Flask, gunicorn |
| Cloud platform | Google Cloud Platform (App Engine Flex, BigQuery, BigQuery ML) |
| Data / ML | `google-cloud-bigquery`, BigQuery `ML.PREDICT` |
| Testing / quality | pytest, pytest-cov, pylint, nbval |
| CI/CD | CircleCI (`google/cloud-sdk` image), `gcloud app deploy` |
| Config / ops | YAML (`app.yaml`, service variants), Shell (`deploy.sh`, `run.sh`), Makefile |
| Library pattern | `myrepolib` (importable package + tests) |

- **Organization:** thin Flask layer over BigQuery/ML module; library + test scaffold separated in `myrepolib/`
- **Reusable modules:** `ml_satellite.query_data()`, `ml_satellite.load_csv()`; `myrepolib.main.myfunc()` and HTTP helper stubs
- **Engineering practice:** cloud-hosted analytics API, ephemeral upload tables, JSON serialization of warehouse rows, multi-environment YAML configs, automated deploy after test/lint gate
