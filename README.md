# Analytics-Applications-Engineering

Welcome to the satellite imagery classification and categorization system built by Edwin Salguero. The application software incorporates cloud-based machine learning models to analyze satellite imagery data. The application is built using Python, Flask, JavaScript, Shell, YAML, and a Makefile, with machine learning algorithms supporting the backend computations. The application also is hosted on Google Cloud Platform and utilized continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to modify the code and update the application. 


A use-case with a focus on analytics software engineering. Development of desktop and client-server solutions and web-based solutions employing a variety of front-end and back-end system components. Machine learning operations and engineering. Using cloud systems to package and distribute containerized computer software. Development of software, working on open-source programming, database, and systems integration projects. Applying best practices in software development.
